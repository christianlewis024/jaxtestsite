    Hello! I am Lyla Lewis
    </h1>
    

    <p class="intro">
        As it turned out, our beloved dog Lyla was not just any ordinary pup. In fact, she was a dragon in disguise! We had always wondered why Lyla's bark was so loud and her breath was so warm, but we never suspected that she was actually a mythical creature. It all became clear one day when Lyla accidentally sneezed and a small flame shot out of her nostrils. We were shocked and amazed, but also a little bit scared. However, Lyla was still our loyal companion, even if she did have a bit of a fiery personality. From that day forward, we made sure to keep a bucket of water handy whenever Lyla got too excited, just in case.

        Lyla the dragon hybrid dog would make a very different president than Joe Biden. For starters, Lyla can breathe fire, which is a pretty unique skill set. Secondly, Lyla doesn't have a history of napping during important meetings. And finally, Lyla would be more likely to chase down an intruder than offer them a friendly handshake. Overall, Lyla would be a fierce and unconventional leader, but hey, sometimes you need a little bit of dragon energy to shake things up in the White House!

    <p class="bottom">Lyla the dog dragon hybrid may have a few weaknesses, but we prefer to think of them as strengths in disguise. For instance, Lyla's love of sunbathing could be seen as a sign of her commitment to self-care and relaxation. And her tendency to chew on furniture? That's just a display of her determination and persistence. Plus, Lyla's stubbornness is really just a sign of her unshakeable conviction, and her tendency to hoard shiny objects is just proof that she has a keen eye for treasure. All in all, Lyla's weaknesses are really just quirks that make her all the more endearing.</p>

    <p class="bullOne">" Lyla the dragon dog would make a great president because she has the ultimate "fire in the belly" attitude. Literally, she can breathe fire! And let's be honest, who doesn't love a president who can light up a room? " - Donald Trump</p>
    <p class="bullTwo">" Lyla would make a fantastic president because she's fiercely loyal to her pack. As a dragon, she knows the value of having a strong community and supporting those around her. Plus, she'd always have the White House security covered with her fire-breathing abilities.  " - Elon Musk</p>
    <p class="bullThree">" Lyla is incredibly determined and never gives up. As a dragon, she's used to facing adversity and overcoming challenges, whether it's slaying a knight or retrieving a ball from under the couch. With her can-do attitude, Lyla would tackle any problem thrown her way as president, even if it involved a pesky squirrel in the rose garden.  " -Lebron James</p>

            As a dragon dog, I understand that sometimes the best running mate is one that balances out your own strengths and weaknesses. That's why I've chosen Lincoln, the plain old regular dog, as my vice president. Sure, he doesn't have any special abilities like breathing fire or flying, but he's got his own unique charm. Plus, his stinky odor can work to our advantage in debates - who wants to argue with a team that smells like they've got nothing to lose? Together, we'll make a dynamic duo, with Lincoln bringing the every-dog perspective and me bringing the fire and fury.
